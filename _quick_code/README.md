# Quick scripts for small tasks

Get all the objects in the scene and move them to origin then exports individually. You need to edit the script to change the file format extension and your local path to save.

Every N frames gets snapshot of a selected model and translate it. Also can rename objects from array of strings. You may need to edit the script for your needs.

Did this one to remove all "TurboSmooth" modifers from scene, but if you edit the class name you can remove any other modifiers.

**Remove_GlareShaderFuckerMissing.ms**
This fix one of the annoying messages of many Max versions that says "GlareShader..." map is missing.

Rename paths by searching a string and replace it, I think, can remember when I did this... :P
